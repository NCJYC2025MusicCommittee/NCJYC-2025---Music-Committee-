    <h2>One Desire – Hillsong Worship</h2>
    <pre>
You gave it all for me
My soul desire, my everything
All I am is devoted to You

How could I fail to see
You are the love that rescued me
And all I am is devoted to You

And oh, how could I not be moved
Lord here with You
So have Your way in me
Cause Lord there is just one thing
And that I will seek

This is my cry, my one desire
Just to be where You are Lord, now and forever
It's more than a song, my one desire
Is to be with You, is to be with You, Jesus

How could I fail to see
You are the love that rescued me
And all I am is devoted to You

And oh, how could I not be moved
Lord here with You
So have Your way in me

Cause Lord there is just one thing
And that I will seek
This is my cry, my one desire
Just to be where You are Lord, now and forever
It's more than a song, my one desire
Is to be with You, is to be with You

This is my cry, my one desire
Just to be where You are Lord, now and forever
It's more than a song, my one desire
Is to be with You, is to be with You, Jesus

The one thing, the one thing that I ask
Is to be with You
The one thing, the one thing that I ask
Is to be with You

The one thing, the one thing that I ask
Is to be with You
The one thing, the one thing that I ask
Is to be with You
Is to be with You

This is my cry, my one desire
Just to be where You are Lord, now and forever
It's more than a song, my one desire
Is to be with You, is to be with You

This is my cry, my one desire
Just to be where You are Lord, now and forever
It's more than a song, my one desire
Is to be with You, is to be with You, Jesus
